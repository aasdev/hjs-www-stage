      <description>About the foundation Halimbi Jamal Shaikh (HJS) Educational Funding was established to promote education as a means for economically disadvantaged Indian minority communities to improve their conditions and fulfill their aspirations. These minorities come from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds, and are educationally deprived compared with their counterpart majority communities.
These communities hail from Kumta and neighboring villages on the West coast of Karnataka State, 500 miles south of Mumbai and 100 miles south of Goa.</description>
